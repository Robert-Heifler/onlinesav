<div class='shopify-product'><h2>Garden Center Sales & Inventory Manager (Microsoft Access Database)</h2><p><strong>Nursery Sales and Inventory Manager</strong> is a ready-to-use Microsoft Access database built for retail nurseries, garden centers, and small greenhouse operations that need better control of customers, inventory, orders, and deliveries.</p><p>Instead of juggling spreadsheets and paper tickets, you get a structured system with four core tables: NurseryCustomers, NurseryProducts, NurserySalesOrders, and NurserySalesOrderLines. Track customer details and preferred contact method, maintain a clean product catalog (SKU, category, supplier, plant type, variety, size, pricing, cost, and quantities), and record every sale as an order header with detailed order lines.</p><p>Orders support the operational details you actually need: order date, requested date, delivery name and address, delivery phone, payment method, and payment status. Line items capture quantities, unit pricing, discounts, taxes, totals, and backorder flags so you can manage partial fulfillment without losing track of what is still owed.</p><p>What makes it powerful is the reporting pack. You receive <strong>17 included reports</strong> that answer the questions that cost you time and money every week:</p><ul><li><strong>Reorder</strong>: see items under reorder and the exact quantity short so you can create a purchase list fast.</li><li><strong>Backorders</strong>: track backordered lines tied to customer, product, dates, and totals so nothing falls through the cracks.</li><li><strong>Delivery</strong>: view requested delivery dates and full delivery details to reduce missed or incorrect drop-offs.</li><li><strong>Inventory Value</strong>: view retail value, cost value, and gross margin value by supplier and category.</li><li><strong>Sales Reporting</strong>: sales by category, customer, payment method, and payment status, plus Top Customers and Top Products.</li></ul><p>All key reports include prompts for date ranges and optional filters like customer name, product name, supplier, category, payment method, payment status, and delivery state. Print order header and order detail paperwork, spot patterns in what sells, and keep inventory levels aligned with seasonal demand.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Microsoft Access (recommended for customization) or the free Microsoft Access Runtime for day-to-day use. Because it is Access, you can customize fields, labels, and report layouts to match how your nursery operates.</p><p><strong>Best for:</strong> small teams that want an affordable, offline-friendly system that improves organization without a full POS replacement.</p><p style='margin-top:20px;'><em>Note: This is a desktop database for Microsoft Access users.
