        <h1>AI Database Builder &mdash; Free vs Upgrade FAQ</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            What you can do with the <span class="accent-free">Free Edition</span> and what changes when you enter the
            <span class="accent-upgrade">upgrade key</span>.
        </p>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q1. What do I get in the Free Edition?</h2>
            <p>
                The <span class="accent-free">Free Edition</span> lets you generate a complete working database structure.
                You can create unlimited tables and up to <strong>six forms or reports</strong>.
                All automation features run normally so you can see exactly how the tool works.
                Start entering your information in the forms and view them with reports.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q2. What happens when I hit the free limit?</h2>
            <p>
                When you try to create a seventh form or report, the tool stops and shows an
                <span class="accent-upgrade">upgrade</span> message.
                Nothing is deleted &mdash; you simply cannot generate new forms or reports until you enter your upgrade key.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q3. If I download the Free Edition again, will it reset the limit?</h2>
            <p>
                No. Re-downloading the same Free Edition gives you the same limits.
                Each copy tracks its own usage inside the file.
                You can always start over with a new copy, but you will hit the same free limit again.
                The fastest way to keep working is to unlock your existing copy with your key.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q4. What does the upgrade key do?</h2>
            <p>
                Entering your <span class="accent-upgrade">upgrade key</span> instantly unlocks
                <strong>unlimited form and report generation</strong> in that copy of the tool.
                It also enables a special button to <strong>export your entire project</strong>
                into a new <strong>editable ACCDB file</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                That exported ACCDB contains all your generated tables, queries, forms, and reports,
                ready to open directly in Microsoft Access.
                Once exported, you (or any developer you choose) can open it in Access and
                <strong>edit any form or report in Design View</strong>,
                adjust layouts, add fields, or build new functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only need to enter your upgrade key once; it stays unlocked for future use.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q5. How much does the upgrade cost?</h2>
            <p>
                A one-time payment of <span class="accent-upgrade">US&nbsp;$39</span> unlocks all features for that copy of the tool.
                No subscriptions, no online activation, and no tracking.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q6. Where do I get the upgrade key?</h2>
            <p>
                Visit
                <a href="https://your-sales-page-url-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                    this upgrade page
                </a>
                to purchase an unlock key. You will receive your key immediately after checkout.

        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q7. Why not just keep using the Free Edition?</h2>
            <p>
                The <span class="accent-free">Free Edition</span> is ideal for initial design and testing.
                Once you start creating more forms or reports or want to move your work into a standalone, editable database,
                upgrading becomes the simplest way to keep everything together and fully customizable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most users upgrade quickly because it saves time and lets them
                <strong>own, edit, and extend</strong> their Access database without limits.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-block">
            <h2>Q8. How does this save me time and money?</h2>
            <p>
                Hiring a Microsoft Access developer typically costs between <strong>$50 and $120 per hour</strong>.
                Even a small setup with the same number of forms or reports allowed in the free edition would usually cost 
                <strong>$300–$700</strong> in professional fees.
                With this builder, the process is automated, consistent, and repeatable &mdash; no hourly billing.
                If you ever need customization beyond the included automation, 
                there are <span class="accent-upgrade">inexpensive options</span> available.
