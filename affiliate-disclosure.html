            <h3>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h3>
            <p>Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the affiliate's own marketing efforts. When you click on an affiliate link on our site and make a purchase on the linked site, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>
